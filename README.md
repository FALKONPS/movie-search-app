# Project Overview

This project is a final project for web preparation at Gaza Sky Geeks.

## Introduction

This app is an anime selection/filtering app with a news discussion page. The website connects with the API [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/), which offers many rich ways to select and filter anime based on various characteristics.

## Limitations

There are several limitations when fetching and loading the API:

- The maximum request number in one second is 3 requests. This means if there is a humming in refreshing the page or clicking the loading button, this can lead to `Many Requests` error.
## Pages
### `index.html`

The index page serves as the homepage.
